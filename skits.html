    <td><p class="mb-3">BULLYING-Use of superior strength or influence to intimidate (someone), typically to force him or her to do what one wants.
In the video you just watched you watched as a young girl was being bullied and given notes to "kill herslef" this is a sign of bullying. We don't know why she was being bullied it could be because of her race or because she wasn't as rich or simpliy beacuse she was smarter than most. Bullying is not okay to any extent you never know what a person is going through or what they have been through. That's why you should take a moment comfort the individual,,listen to their story, and never make the situation about you. This could stop someone from harming themself or another individual and decrease the numbers of sucicide and increase the happiness of others.          </p></td>

Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, and "OTHER. Does your racial identity define you? Well it shouldn't you are special because of your personality and beacuse of the way you choose to act. Everyone is unique and made differently for a reason so that doesn't give you a reason to change who you choose to be. Why do we care so much about determining people's ethnicity?  WE as a collective have choosen to go in the direction that our ancestors and as the 2000 generation should take a different path and create a new space for all races,cultures,and religions.</p></div></td>
