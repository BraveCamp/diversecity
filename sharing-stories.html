                </h2>
                <p>Many people are currently dealing  with racism. I have seen it through out my life. As a Hispanic I've heard many stereotypes about not just Hispanics but about many other cultures. A person that is not born in the United States deals with people looking at them like if they just didn't belong and can't fit in. People can say the most meanest things. I have seen my firends get called out for just speaking their language. I have heard people say "Get out of this country." I have also heard other things like "You don't belong here", "Speak ENGLISH or get out". Racism is the most cruelest thing a person can do to another person. At the end of the day we are who we are and we should all be proud of where we came from and say it loud and proud.  </p>
               
                <a class="navbar-brand text-uppercase text-expanded font-weight-bold d-lg-none" href="">Being Proud</a> 
                </h2>
                <pstyle="color: #0066ff"> BEING PROUD!-This is the story of a girl from El Salvador and later on moving to my school. Her mother, sister and herself came to the United States to live a better life. When they got to the United States they had a difficult time speaking English. When the girl started going to school she struggled through with explaning herself and making friends. When I saw that she was struggling with speaking English I decided to help her in English and other classes. During lunch I would help her with the classes she had and we would practice speaking english. Around the school I would see kids laughing at her and talking about her behind her back. There would be times when she would tell me that she felt uncomfortable and like people where saying mean stuff about her in English. As the school year went by she realized that it didn't matter where she came from she didn't have to hide it instead she had to show how proud she was to have been born in a different country and to speak other then english. </p>
